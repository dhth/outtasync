# outtasync

‚ú® Overview
---

`outtasync` helps users quickly identify the CloudFormation stacks that have
gone out of sync with the state represented by their counterpart stack files.
This can occur when someone updates a stack but fails to commit the latest stack
file to the codebase. Alternatively, it may happen when a stack is updated on
one deployment environment but not on others. ü§∑

üíæ Installation
---

**homebrew**:

```sh
brew install dhth/tap/outtasync
```

**go**:

```sh
go install github.com/dhth/outtasync@latest
```

üõ†Ô∏è Pre-requisites
---

- `git` (used to show the diff for out-of-sync changes)
    - `outtasync` doesn't change or override git's pager, so the diff will
        follow your `.gitconfig` settings (if present).

üõ†Ô∏è Configuration
---

Create a configuration file that looks like the following. By default,
`outtasync` will look for this file at `~/.config/outtasync.yml`.

```yaml
globalRefreshCommand: aws sso login --sso-session sessionname
profiles:
- name: qa
  stacks:
  - name: bingo-service-qa
    local: ~/projects/bingo-service/cloudformation/infrastructure.yml
    region: eu-central-1
    refreshCommand: aws sso login --profile qa1
  - name: papaya-service-qa
    local: ~/projects/papaya-service/cloudformation/service.yml
    region: eu-central-1
  - name: racoon-service-qa
    local: ~/projects/racoon-service/cloudformation/service.yml
    region: eu-central-1
- name: prod
  stacks:
  - name: brb-dll-prod
    local: ~/projects/brd-dll-service/cloudformation/service.yml
    region: eu-central-1
    refreshCommand: aws sso login --profile rgb-prod
  - name: galactus-service-prod
    local: ~/projects/galactus-service/cloudformation/service.yml
    region: eu-central-1
```

`refreshCommand` overrides `globalRefreshCommand` whereever set.

*Note: The `globalRefreshCommand` and `refreshCommand` settings are only needed
if you want to invoke the command that refreshes your AWS credentials via the
TUI directly.*

‚ö°Ô∏è Usage
---

```bash
outtasync
outtasync -config-file /path/to/config.yml
outtasync -profiles qa,prod
```

By default, `outtasync` runs in TUI mode. You can also run it in CLI mode (where
it outputs the results to stdout) using `-mode=cli` flag.

TODO
---

- [ ] Add a command to generate a sample config file
- [x] Add CLI mode

`outtasync` is built using the awesome TUI framework [bubbletea][1].
